// How to use predefined functions.
// This program uses the math functions pow and sqrt to determine
// and output the volume of a sphere, the distance between two 
// points, respectively, and the string function length to find
// the number of characters in a string.
// If the radius of the sphere is r, then the volume of the sphere
// is (4/3)*PI*r^3. If (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of two
// points in the XY-plane, then the distance between these points is 
// sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).
